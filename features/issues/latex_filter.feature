Feature: Parse BibTeX files and convert LaTeX to Unicode
	As a hacker who works with bibliographies
	I want to be able to parse BibTeX files containing LaTeX strings and
	convert them to Unicode

	@latex
  Scenario: A BibTeX file containing a LaTeX umlaut
     When I parse the following file:
     """
     @misc{issue16,
       author = {rbq},
       title  = {An umlaut: \"u!},
       year   = 2011,
     }
     """
     Then my bibliography should contain an entry with key "issue16"
     When I convert all entries using the filter "latex"
     Then the entry with key "issue16" should have a field "title" with the value "An umlaut: ü!"

  Scenario: A BibTeX file containing a variety of LaTeX strings
    When I parse the following file:
