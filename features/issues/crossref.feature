Feature: Parse BibTeX cross-references
  As a hacker who works with bibliographies
  I want to be able to parse BibTeX files with cross-referenced entries

Scenario: A BibTeX file with six entries and three cross-references
	When I parse the following file:

  And the entry with key "cartwright_1989a" should have a field "Year" with the value "1989"
